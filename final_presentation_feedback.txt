Group 6 -- 95/100

Overall, good job, the tool looks really solid overall with a nice and functional front end and a well-engineered back end. Below are some specific comments/feedback:

Pros:
- very impressive demo
- meta-thinking about how plagiarism is usually done, good job with this
- good job choosing the algorithms, looks like a lot of thought put into what algorithms chosen and their respective tradeoffs
- good discussion about the use of canonical names for variables and functions
- demonstrated solid understanding of design choices
- nice work on the analysis of code comments
- good job with some really thoughtful engineering of language representations
- overall looks like a really solid project

Cons:
- awkward team dynamics, and the presentation was not rehearsed
