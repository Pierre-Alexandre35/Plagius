Group 6 ---- 94
- UI mockups look good, good idea with highlighting
- motivation for incorporating file integrity into the system was not very clear
- class diagram does a good job of visualizing high-level architecture of the system
- class diagrams also do a good job of showing the results that will be generated by the analysis
- high-level goal about providing enough abstraction to represent both languages is very good idea
- enhancements on ANTLR (adding context sensitivity for scoping) seems very interesting
- good plan for division of labour and with code sprints -- feel free to come to prof/TAs to talk about the results of the sprints
- good, detailed work plan with concrete goals
