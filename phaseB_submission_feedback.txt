Score: 93
- nice description of division of labour, looks good
- nice UI mockups and good job showing the workflow of the application
- UML class diagram also looks good
- not enough documentation in the Java interfaces -- methods are not commented so it's unclear what functionality to expect from them
- nice use of default methods, and code generally looks good
